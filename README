L is a toy project to implement a lisp-like language in C. The objective here
is to end up with a language with simple evaluation rules (lisp.c/lisp.h) and
simple primitive operations (primitives.c/primitives.h) where the code and data
are made of dual pointers (NODE) often referred to as "cons cells" in other 
dialects. This amounts to writing a virtual machine to evaluate cons cells (this
project) which could be easily ported to any language or architecture. Source is
